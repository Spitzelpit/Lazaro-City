    <p class="cv-1">Umberto Votta, aka Lazaro, is a digital artist based in Milan, Italy. Born in 1991, he gained recognition in the digital art world, particularly in 3D art, with exhibitions in London and the United States, and features in industry magazines. His work blends the vivid tones of fantasy with futuristic settings inspired by the Cyberpunk genre. Vast megacities filled with neon and steel serve as backdrops for scenes of everyday life, aiming to spark reflection on the human-technology relationship in an increasingly digital and alienating world.</p>
    <p class="cv-2" style="color: rgb(173, 183, 195);">“I’ve been drawn to art since I can remember; I’ve produced electronic music for many years, back then I used to make my own EP’s covers using Gimp, those were my very first attempts at visual arts. During the Covid lockdown, in early 2020, I discovered Virtual Photography, which is the art of taking photos in videogames, and that was the beginning of my journey as “Lazaro”; as the world of gaming is very close to 3D, I soon discovered many artists that were doing some incredible stuff and I thought “wow I could really create my own worlds instead of taking shots in existing ones!”, so I started learning Blender and immediately fell in love with it. I’ve always been a fan of the cyberpunk genre, growing up with masterpieces like Blade Runner, Ghost In The Shell and Akira; among my very first and most important influences were the works by artists like Dangiuz, Max Hay and Daniel Liang, but the list goes on and on.”</p>
